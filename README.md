# Masterclass Tutorial on Generative Adversarial Networks

The gan-turorial.py file containts placeholder functions that will help us run the Generative Adversarial Network. You can read what each function does from the comments.



What you need to do:
You need to add code inside the following three functions:

get_generator() creates a neural network model for a generator

get_discriminator() creates a neural network model for a discriminator

get_gan_network() creates links the generator and discriminator together
